# Project-Catwalk

Project Catwalk is a client-facing retail web-portal. Our client asked us to update the website while still allowing it to use their existing API that served up the product data. Our goal was to create a sleek looking front end that interacted with this API appropriately. By creating an eye-catching front-end and combining it with updated technologies, we were able to dramatically improve user experience, which ultimately contributes to higher sales volume. Shopping should be fun, and we wanted our users to experience that while shopping on our website. We used React and CSS to build the components of the website, and utilized Express to handle and serve the API requests. There is a full list of all the technologies used at the very bottom of this readme.

## Overview
The overview showcases the product and its important information. It allows the user to browse through the different styles and pricing for the product, add it to their cart, and purchase it. Our goal was to make it easy for a user to look at and purchase the product, so we made it very simple to navigate through and use. We wanted to provide a big view of the product, while also showing off the other styles in smaller capacities with thumbnails. The user can also expand the featured photo for an even closer look. 

## Related Products 
The Related Products section displays a carousel of other popular items that the user might be interested in. Here, a user can compare items in the carousel against the current product. Clicking on the cards within the carousel will open up the product page for that item. Our goal here was to interest users in other products that past users were observed with purchasing or looking at. Additionally, a user can put together an outfit in a secondary carousel. Ultimately, we are interested in getting as many products in front of our users in a way that draws them in.

## Questions and Answers 
The Q&A section allows users to explore inquiries and insights relating to the current product. A personal anecdote is a very powerful thing when it comes to marketing and sales, so we wanted to give users the ability to read and share other opinions. They can ask other users questions about the product, and users who have purchased the product can answer the questions. Users are also allowed to upload photos of the product that can help answer the question.

## Ratings and Reviews 
In this section, users can provide their feedback on the product. Building on the idea of a personal anecdote, we also want to give users the means to make an informed decision. Here, the user can submit a rating out of 5, and also provide further details about fit, quality and comfort.  Users can also filter reviews based on rating or relevance or time. They can also submit photos of the product to show other users how it might look or fit.
