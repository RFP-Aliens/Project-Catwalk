# Project-Catwalk
Project Catwalk is a client-facing retail web-portal.

Project Catwalk is our team's response to a request to update an ecommerce website. Our client tasked us with using an existing API that served up their product data. Our goal was to create a sleek looking front end that interacted with this API appropriately. We used React and CSS to build the components of the website, and utilized Express to handle and serve the API requests. There is a full list of all the technologies used at the very bottom of this readme.

The website is separated into four different sections, each one spearheaded by each of our team members.

## Overview
The product overview showcases the product, provides detailed information, and allows the user to add it to their cart, and purchase it. The user can also navigate through the different styles of the product, with each style having a small gallery of images showcasing the product.

## Related Products 
The Related Products section displays a carousel of other popular items that the user might be interested in. Here, a user can compare items in the carousel against the current product. Clicking on the cards within the carousel will open up the product page for that item.

## Questions and Answers 
The Q&A section allows users to explore inquiries and insights relating to the current product. They can ask other users questions about the product, and users who have purchased the product can answer the questions. Users are also allowed to upload photos of the product that can help answer the question.

## Ratings and Reviews 
In this section, users can provide their feedback on the product. They can submit a rating out of 5, and also provide details about fit, quality and comfort.  Users can also filter reviews based on rating or relevance or time. They can also submit photos of the product to show other users how it might look or fit.
